# Cryptography

## Assignment 1, Task 4 (8 points)
~~~~
Consider the following sequence of operations:
Plaintext -> S1 -> P1 -> S2 -> P2 -> Ciphertext

Plaintext is MOTIVATION.

S1 is a shift cipher with key kS1 = 17.
S2 is a shift cipher with the key kS2 = 8.
P1 is a permutation cipher with a key kP1 = (5, 1, 3, 2, 4).
P2 is a permutation cipher with a key kP2 = (3, 4, 5, 1, 2).

The task: what is the ciphertext?
